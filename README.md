AI/ML Engineer & Full-Stack Developer
I am a 3rd-year AIML student at Atria Institute of Technology (CGPA: 8.9/10) with a mission to bridge the gap between complex machine learning models and user-centric web applications.

🔭 Currently working on: Advanced predictive modeling and computer vision systems.

🌱 Learning: Scalable MLOps and LLM Fine-tuning.

⚡ Fun Fact: I don't just build models; I build the interfaces that make them useful.

Hey Shaik! That is a solid foundation you’ve built. An 8.9 CGPA in AIML is impressive, and having the "Full-Stack ML" mindset (knowing how to actually deploy what you build) is exactly what the industry is looking for in 2026.

To make this the best version, we need to add a bit more "punch" to your professional identity. We'll organize your skills more strategically and add a section for projects, which is the heartbeat of an AI engineer's profile.

Here is a revamped, high-impact version for your GitHub README or Portfolio:
